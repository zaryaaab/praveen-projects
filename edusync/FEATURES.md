## Architecture Overview

The application follows a standard Spring Boot architecture with the following components:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Implement business logic
- **Repositories**: Manage data persistence
- **Models**: Define data structures
- **Configuration**: Handle application configuration

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot 3.4.5
- **Java Version**: 21
- **Database**: H2 (Development)
- **Template Engine**: Thymeleaf
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Containerization**: Docker
